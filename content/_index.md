I'm a bioinformatician living in Copenhagen's awesome Vesterbro neighborhood. I spend my days building the data plumbing for huge biobanks that help us understand complex diseases. I'm obsessed with squashing batch effects, making smart guesses for missing data, and making sure our genetic studies are on the level. My biggest project so far is iPSYCH, a massive Danish biobank with data from 150,000 people, all to help us understand mental health better.

For the last couple of years, I've been a Senior Technical Data Steward at Novo Nordisk, where I'm on a mission to make our experimental data FAIR and ready for AI and machine learning. I build cloud-native apps using microservices, sprinkle in some natural language processing, and use fancy ontologies to make sure our data products play nicely with each other.

I also got to help modernize our compound database, which was a blast. I built logical data models for everything from old-school molecules to the latest and greatest in R&D.

When I'm not wrangling data, you can find me running or hanging out with my amazing 1-year-old daughter, Meenakshi.
