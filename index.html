I build cloud-native apps using microservices, sprinkle in some natural language processing, and use fancy ontologies to make sure our data products play nicely with each other.</p><p>I also got to help modernize our compound database, which was a blast. I built logical data models for everything from old-school molecules to the latest and greatest in R&amp;D.</p><p>When I&rsquo;m not wrangling data, you can find me running or hanging out with my amazing 1-year-old daughter, Meenakshi.</p></article><div class="pa3 pa4-ns w-100 w-70-ns center"><section class="w-100 mw8"><div class="w-100 mb4 relative"><article class="bb b--black-10"><div class="db pv4 ph3 ph0-l dark-gray no-underline"><div class="flex-column flex-row-ns flex"><div class="blah w-100"><h1 class="f3 fw1 athelas mt0 lh-title"><a href=/resume/ class="color-inherit dim link">Resume</a></h1><div class="f6 f5-l lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><h2 id=professional-summary>Professional Summary</h2><p>I&rsquo;m a bioinformatics professional with over 12 years of experience in pharmaceutical research, clinical science and academic settings, specializing in the development, modernization, and support of scientific software solutions and informatics processes.
